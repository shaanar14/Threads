Operating Systems Assignment 2

P1 uses Farmer & Bridge to simulate the single lane bridge problem using threads.

P2 uses Customer & Restaraunt to simulate a COVID safe restaraunt using multiple threads.

P3 uses MonitoredCustomer, MonitoredRestaraunt & RestarauntMonitor to simulate the same thing as P2 but with a RestarauntMonitor object to behave similarly to a semaphore object.
